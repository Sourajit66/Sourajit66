Our research in the group most broadly focuses on global biogeochemical cycles and climate, both in the modern and throughout Earth’s history. We integrate field, petrographic, geochemical and laboratory work with numerical models, to test hypotheses of global change that concern the co-evolution of microbial life and its environment. A central theme of our research is to better understand processes that regulate the global carbon cycle, and the mechanisms that give rise to planetary climate stability. We are also working to assess the potential of accelerating silicate weathering for large scale carbon capture through field, numerical modelling and machine learning methods.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Carbon capture</title><link href="/jekyll/update/2025/01/26/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Carbon capture" /><published>2025-01-26T03:00:15+13:00</published><updated>2025-01-26T03:00:15+13:00</updated><id>/jekyll/update/2025/01/26/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="/jekyll/update/2025/01/26/welcome-to-jekyll.html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
