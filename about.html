<p>Welcome to the Earth-Life Interactions Group page. For me, life began on the island country of Singapore. After 2 years as a Naval Diving Unit operative in the Underwater Demolition Group, I relocated to Scotland (University of St Andrews) and subsequently America for a PhD (Yale University).</p>

<p>Our research in the group most broadly focuses on global biogeochemical cycles and climate, both in the modern and throughout Earth’s history. We integrate field, petrographic, geochemical, and laboratory work with numerical models to test hypotheses of global change that concern the co-evolution of microbial life and its environment.</p>

<p>A central theme of our research is to better understand processes that regulate the global carbon cycle and the mechanisms that give rise to planetary climate stability. We are also working to assess the potential of accelerating silicate weathering for large-scale carbon capture through field, numerical modeling, and machine learning methods.</p>
