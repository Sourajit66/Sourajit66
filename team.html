      <p>
        Welcome to the Earth-Life Interactions Group page. For me life began on the island country of Singapore. After 2 years as a Naval Diving Unit operative in the Underwater Demolition Group, I relocated to Scotland (University of St Andrews) and subsequently America for a PhD (Yale University). Our research in the group most broadly focuses on global biogeochemical cycles and climate, both in the modern and throughout Earth’s history. We integrate field, petrographic, geochemical and laboratory work with numerical models, to test hypotheses of global change that concern the co-evolution of microbial life and its environment. A central theme of our research is to better understand processes that regulate the global carbon cycle, and the mechanisms that give rise to planetary climate stability. We are also working to assess the potential of accelerating silicate weathering for large scale carbon capture through field, numerical modelling and machine learning methods.

      <p>
        A lifelong love for the natural world has steered Sofia into the field of geochemistry and paleoclimate. Her passions drive her to better understand the interactions between life and Earth surface environments over time, and the biogeochemical feedbacks that arise from it. With a strong background in geology and geochemistry, Sofia’s research will shed light on the coupled evolution of the marine biosphere and climate on Earth.

      <p>
        Born and raised in a small town in East India that experiences extreme weather conditions, Sourajit has been a spectator of a rapidly changing environment. Sourajit completed a master's degree looking at the isotopic distribution of carbon in IAB iron meteorites. With his background in geochemistry and data science, Sourajit is now working to test the effectiveness and scalability of natural carbon capture techniques.

      <strong>Zoe Gibert</strong>
      <span class="position">PhD Student</span>
      <p>
        Zoé has always had a special affinity for vast, wild natural spaces and a fascination with the dynamics of the Earth. During her bachelor's and master's degrees in the Geosciences, she developed a special interest in Earth’s deep multi-billion-year history that has led to today’s habitable world. Zoé uses geochemical and modeling tools to study atmosphere-ocean-biosphere interactions and their role in shaping the Earth’s surface environment through time. Her work aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how processes within the globally coupled carbon-silica cycle regulate the Earth’s climate.

        James inspired from a young age by the likes of movies like Jurassic park and Jaws, is awed by Earth's diversity and about Life evolved alongside the ever changing global climate. Brought up in canadian countryside countryside James has a specialty in Geochemistry and Paleontology and using his distinct skill set is attempting to decipher the relationship between effect of life on paleoclimate and ocean chemistry in tandem.
